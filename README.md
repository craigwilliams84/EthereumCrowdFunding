# EthereumCrowdFunding

An implementation of an Ethereum crowd funding platform for the B9Labs final project.

NOTE:  The application has been implemented as described in the spec, with the fund method calling payout or refund to send funds automatically (push), but this is generally bad practise and a pull approach should really be implemented.

## To run the app
- Start geth
- `truffle migrate`
- `truffle serve`

## To run the tests
- `testrpc`
- `truffle test`
